# PatriceSmash
“Patrice Smash” is a very basic computer game that is based on the well-known “Nintendo Super Smash Bros”. Fighters will compete to be the last man standing on the platform. You will be able to select from a list of characters including Patrice the butt-kicking duck, Super Grover the crime-fighting hero of Sesame Street, and Roger the Ripped Kangaroo. Fighters will also be able to choose which map they compete on.
